## Version 2 highlights

* **Amazon Cognito** – is a simple user identity and synchronization service that helps you securely manage and synchronize app data for your users across their mobile devices. With Amazon Cognito, you can save any kind of data, such as app preferences or game state, in the AWS Cloud without writing any backend code or managing any infrastructure.
* **Amazon Mobile Analytics** – is a service for collecting, visualizing and understanding app usage data at scale. Amazon Mobile Analytics reports are typically updated within 60 minutes from when data are received. Amazon Mobile Analytics is built to scale with the business and can collect and process billions of events from millions of endpoints.
* **Amazon Kinesis Recorder** – enables you to reliably record data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream from your mobile app. Kinesis Recorder batches requests to handle intermittent network connection and enable you to record events even when the device is offline.
* **Amazon S3 Transfer Manager** - We have added the ability to pause and resume downloads/uploads to make transferring files to S3 faster and easier.
