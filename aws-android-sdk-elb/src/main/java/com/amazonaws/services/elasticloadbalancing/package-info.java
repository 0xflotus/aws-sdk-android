 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonElasticLoadBalancing.
 *
 * Elastic Load Balancing <p>
 * A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across your EC2
 * instances. This enables you to increase the availability of your
 * application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its
 * registered instances and ensures that it routes traffic only to
 * healthy instances. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming
 * traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with
 * a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load
 * balancer and a protocol and port number for connections from the load
 * balancer to the instances. For more information, see the
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/"> Elastic Load Balancing Developer Guide </a>
 * .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For information about the AWS regions supported by Elastic Load
 * Balancing, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elb_region"> Regions and Endpoints - Elastic Load Balancing </a>
 * in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All Elastic Load Balancing operations are <i>idempotent</i> , which
 * means that they complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation,
 * it succeeds with a 200 OK response code.
