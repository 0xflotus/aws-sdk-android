# Change Log - AWS SDK for Android

## [Release 2.2.6](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.2.6) (09/17/2015)

### New Features
- **Amazon Web Services**: General service updates and documentation improvements.
- **Amazon S3**: Added support of ObjectMetadata for upload in Amazon S3 `TransferUtility`. [#56](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/issues/56)

### Bug Fixes
- **AWS Core Runtime Library**: Fixed a potential NPE issue caused by ResponseCache by explicitly disabling HTTP response cache.

## [Release 2.2.5](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.2.5) (08/07/2015)

### New Features

### Bug Fixes
- **Amazon S3**: Fixed a bug when using Amazon S3 `TransferUtility` on a worker thread. [#51](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/issues/51)
- **AWS Core Runtime Library**: Fixed a bug caused by improper closing of a GZIP encoded content stream. See [AWS forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=204659).
- **Maven**: Changed the dependency scope of Apache Commons Logging to [`provided`](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html) which can remove compilation warnings and improve capability with Gradle.


## [Release 2.2.4](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.2.4) (07/22/2015)

### New Features
- **Amazon S3**: The S3 transfer utility has been added to the SDK, which replaces the now deprecated transfer manager. This utility automatically pauses and resumes transfers when internet connectivity is lost and reestablished. The utility also automatically pauses transfers if an app crashes. Developers can manually pause and resume transfers without having to persist any data themselves. For more information, see our [blog](http://mobile.awsblog.com/post/Tx2KF0YUQITA164/AWS-SDK-for-Android-Transfer-Manager-to-Transfer-Utility-Migration-Guide) and [Getting Started documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/s3transferutility.html) for more info.
- **Amazon Mobile Analytics**: A new simpler constructor has been added to the MobileAnalyticsManager, and transmission of events over WAN is now enabled by default.


## [Release 2.2.3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.2.3) (07/09/2015)

### New Features
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Added a runtime library for the generated SDK of Amazon API Gateway. Amazon API Gateway makes it easy for AWS customers to publish, maintain, monitor, and secure application programming interfaces (APIs) at any scale. To know more please visit [Amazon API Gateway]( http://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/).

### Bug Fixes
- **Amazon S3**: Fixed an issue in Amazon S3 where the range information is incorrect in PersistableTransfer. [#35](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/issues/35)
- **AWS Core Runtime Library**: Fixed an issue in `CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider` where the credentials might not be cached when using developer-authenticated identities. [#48](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/issues/48)


## [Release 2.2.2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.2.2) (06/11/2015)

### New Features
- **AWS Core Runtime Library**: Enabled HTTP compression by adding "Accept-Encoding:gzip" header. If the target AWS service (for example, Amazon DynamoDB) supports compression and returns compressed data, the SDK will handle the content correctly. [#41](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/issues/41)
- **Amazon Kinesis**: KinesisRecorder now sends compressed records to Amazon Kinesis.
- **Amazon Mobile Analytics**: Analytics events are compressed prior to sending the service in order to save network bandwidth.

### Bug Fixes
- **Amazon S3**: Fixed an issue that occurs when required headers are not properly signed. This issue affects S3 in two regions: Frankfurt (eu-central-1) and China (cn-north-1). [#42](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/issues/42)
- **AWS Core Runtime Library**: Fixed an issue in Maven distribution where an incorrect version string is set in "User-Agent".
